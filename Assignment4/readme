I tried installing TAU on HPC but I could fix all issues after multiple attempts so I ran the code on CSE-cluster with TAU.
The subfolders contain reports in a prograssive manner, 4.1 has only the report for part 4.1, 4.2 has the report of both 4.1 and 4.2 and so on. 
I've added the report outside the sub-folders as well. There are some jobscripts in 4.1 and 4.3. The modified parmetis code is in 4.3.
