OBSERVATIONS:
I used the most straight forward and inefficient way to implement MPI_Reduce in point-to-point since the problem allowed me choose any algorithm. The result is clearly visible in the plots, as the P-to-P performance is very poor in terms of execution times when compared to the collective call.

NO ISSUES
