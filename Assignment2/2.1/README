OBSERVATION:
From the graphs I can see the performance for the collective implementation is poorer than that of the point-to-point implementation for all cases. One possible reason for this could be that the gather call was designed to handle larger input properly as compared to the smaller inputs.

ISSUES:
I faced no difficulty in implementing this part.
