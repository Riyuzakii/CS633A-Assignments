SUB-PART: 1.2

OBSERVATIONS:
1) For optimized P->C mapping, I used the code from 1.2 with a slightly different mapping. Instead of a modulo based grouping among processes, I mapped consecutive processes(in terms of rank) in same communication group.
2) For all values of D, the program shows maximum speed up for 2 nodes(16 processes) and then a steady decrease for all further cases.

ISSUES:
1) The real issue here was that the problem wasn't clear initially in terms of mapping and whether to use P-to-P or collectives.
