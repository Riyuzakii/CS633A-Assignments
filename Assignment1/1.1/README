SUB-PART: 1.1

OBSERVATIONS:
1) For point-to-point case the speed up increases drastically from the one node case and remains nearly same for the rest of the cases for all values of D.

ISSUES:
1) The point-to-point case was pretty straight forward, I faced no issues.
2) There were several issues while installation, but they were all circumstantial.

INSTRUCTIONS:

$ chmod +x run.sh
$ ./run.sh
