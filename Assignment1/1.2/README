SUB-PART: 1.2

OBSERVATIONS:
1) For D= {1, 1024}, I saw a sudden drop in speed up for the case of 8 nodes. Otherwise there's not set pattern, but one can go so far as to say that plot for every D-value reaches a maxima at 2 or 4 nodes.

ISSUES:
1) I was initially using MPI_Bcast, which  may or may not block in case of large number of processes, so I switched to the non-blocking version MPI_Ibcast.
2) If the length of message sent is not exactly equal to count then I got stack smashing error, exit code 139, which according to a helpful stackoverflow answer is a Seg_fault.
