# report-hpc-opt.pdf contains the plots after the optimizations(according to me).
# S3D-IO-hpc-opt contains files for the same

# I've plotted starting with 16 processes, because I had run the script once and it would have taken too much time to run it again.

# python <output-filename> : plots the graphs from output file separately
